The case: 

Contact details. This usually includes information about the client and who is the main contact person (name) and who else (other names) is involved in making purchasing decisions - what are their roles; addresses of client accounts, phone numbers, emails, accounts in social networks, instant messengers and postal addresses.

Contact history. Information about who, when and how communicated with the client - dates and tools (phone, email, instant messenger). Description of communication results and contact person’s notes.

Transaction History. Description of purchases (price and date of purchase) and reactions to offers - what they were offered to buy and what was bought from it.

Current pipeline. Analytics on current opportunities (status of the offer) for each specific client. For example, what is the probability that he will buy the proposed product or service (just like that or at the promotional price), expressed as a percentage: 10, 20, 30 ... 90% success. Some CRMs allow you to predict such probabilities for various marketing tools.

Opportunities. Unlike the “contact history”, which reflects the past, this section is focused on the future. It records potential opportunities that have not yet been proposed and implemented.

Products. It indicates what products and services the client has bought. Whether there were any problems associated with these purchases (for example, there was damage during delivery or an incomplete set), how they were resolved.

Communication preferences. Description of the most effective way of communication or the one that the client prefers: email, telephone, specific instant messenger, social network. Here you also need to specify the preferred time and treatment option (name, dear, Mr. or Mrs.).
